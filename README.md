As described in the article, there were four procedures:
"From our research material we estimated separately 40, 55 and 75 topics as suggested by the different available methodological  criteria (Deveaud, Sanjuan, & Bellot 2014; Arun et al., 2010; Griffiths & Steyvers, 2004; Cao et al., 2009; Figure 1)."

Acknowledging volatility risks in topic modeling we estimated each of our models a number of times for better robustness. Established criteria lacking, we estimated both the 40, 55 and 75 topics five times.
Established criteria also lacking, we chose for in-depth consideration topics in a decreasing order of probability until their combined probability reached 80% of the total probability of 100% in each of our fifteen rounds of estimation. The 80% criterion gave altogether 70 topicsâ€”20 topics with the 40-topic model, and 25 topics both with 55 and 75 topics. As we estimated each of our topics five times, we had 350 topics to start with. Among these topics the lowest average probability of a topic that was included ranged from 0.95% with 75 topics to 1.67% with 40 topics.
Having to use researcher judgment in the absence of established methodological criteria, we compared the 350 topics with each other. Within our research team we consensually picked for in-depth investigation those topics that came up at least in thirteen of our fifteen rounds (86.7%) of topic modeling.
